            <Paragraph Margin="20,10,325,0" FontSize="22">
                I am an aspirant of cutting edge technologies. I see a lot of potential in modern Computer Science Technologies, and the most
                trendy example of which is the Machine Learning and AI. There are many growing fields in Computer Science that can change 
                the world.
I,              as an aspirant of these technologies, wish to play my role in a significant way. With the scholarship, I wish to pursue 
                applied computer science learning giving in the best I can. Currently, I'm learning to build intelligent Machine Learning 
                models for language translation and market prediction and also began to get into android app development.
            </Paragraph>
            
            <Paragraph Margin="20,10,40,0" FontSize="22">
                The greatest adversity I faced so far was either lack of knowledge or no access to cloud computing for training my models, 
                and it is just insane to train a machine learning model with a dataset spanning to several Gigs onto a local machine.
                I figured out I needed to learn and improve my understanding over optimization of the training processes and needed
                access to cloud computing power of the tech giants.

            <Paragraph Margin="20,10,40,0" FontSize="22">
                I started learning with tensorflow tutorials on the internet and for cloud access, I got an opportunity to be a part of 
                Microsoft's Student Partner Program (MSP Program), in which access to their cloud and other services becomes easy and free for me.
                Yet I was wondering to explore, and I got student benefits on Google cloud platform and I'm already loving it.
